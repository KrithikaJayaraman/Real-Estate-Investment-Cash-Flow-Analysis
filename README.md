# Real-Estate-Investment-Cash-Flow-Analysis
This repository contains the real-time simulation of Net Present Values for Homes considered for Investment.

# Scenario

It is a known fact that the Net Present Value and Market value of a property is subject to various economic uncertainties. This makes the market value stochastic in nature. Estimating the real value of a property is important in a variety of cases such as real estate for sale, investment analysis, property insurance, etc. Here in this case study, we apply Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate market values at some point in future before deciding on an investment. We use a Discounted Cash Flow Model using the time value of money concept.

The goal of the project is to identify most profitable property of the two homes considered for investment. We assume that we take a 30-year Mortgage. 

**Simulation tool used: MS Excel & RISK Optimizer.**
